# Pandas 
Pandas is a Python library to deal with sequential and tabular data. It includes many tools to manage, analyze and manipulate data in a convenient and efficient manner. We can think of its data structures as akin to database tables or spreadsheets.

Pandas is built on top of the Numpy library and has two primary data structures viz. Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2- dimensional). It can handle both homogeneous and heterogeneous data, and some of its many capabilities are:

• ETL tools (Extraction, Transformation and Load tools)

• Dealing with missing data (NaN)

• Dealing with data files (csv, xls, db, hdf5, etc.)

• Time-series manipulation tools

In the Python ecosystem, Pandas is the best choice to retrieve, manipulate,analyze and transform financial data.


# Pandas Installation

pip install pandas


# Pandas works on
Pandas for Homogeneous (1-Dimension) and Hetrogeneous(2-Dimension) Tabular method.

• Indexes and labels.
• Searching of elements.
• Insertion, deletion and modification of elements.
• Apply set techniques, such as grouping, joining, selecting, etc.
• Data processing and cleaning.
• Work with time series.
• Make statistical calculations
• Draw graphics
• Connectors for multiple data file formats, such as, csv, xlsx, hdf5, etc.


# Pandas Series

Series homogeneous one-dimensional objects, that is, all data are of the same type and are implicitly labeled with an index.

we can have a Series of integers, real numbers, characters,strings, dictionaries, etc. We can conveniently manipulate these series
performing operations like adding, deleting, ordering, joining, filtering,vectorized operations, statistical analysis, plotting, etc.
