# Variables
In Python, variables need NOT be declared or defined in advance, as is the case in many other programming languages. In fact, Python has no command for declaring a variable. To create a variable, we assign a value to it and start using it.

A variable is created the moment we assign the first value to it.

# Creating a variable
price = 226      # Intializing the variable

print(price)

price=230          # Assigning New Value to variable

print(price)

# chain assignment operation to variables in Python
x=y=z=100

print(x,y,z)

y=101

print(x,y,z)


# Variable Naming Conventions
#A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character

stock ='AXIS'

_name='HDFC'

print(stock,_name)

## A variable name cannot start with a number.

1stock='axis'

print(stock)
